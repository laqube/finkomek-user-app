-I believe this repo must be called finkomek-web-app <br>
-why?
-Well because there are user and expert applications, two in one. Expert routes are available through /expert-login route.<br>
-Ok then, when the expert app will be ready?
-I don't know, hopefully till the end of this week

-I feel defeated today. Did not write a line of code. I'm doing my best to keep my sanity.
-Even though theoretically I could do better, I think lack of sleep from the last night affected me too much.

-The predefence is tomorrow, gotta work extra hard for this one, and then it's only the matter of implementing videocalls.
So this is my list of todos for this night:
<ul>
 <li>Complete the course purchase on catalogue page</li>
 <li>Render purchased course list on user page</li>
 <li>Render course by content</li>
 <li>Add dynamic routing or think of how to show course content otherwise</li>
 <li>Work on Expert's page</li>
 <li>Work on expert's modal or expert's catalogue page(if catalogue, use dynamic routing)</li>
 <li>Work on Chat layout</li>
</ul>
