-I believe this repo must be called finkomek-web-app
-why?
-Well because there are user and expert applications, two in one. Expert routes are available through /expert-login route.
-Ok then, when the expert app will be ready?
-I don't know, hopefully till the end of this week

-I feel defeated today. Did not write a line of code. I'm doing my best to keep my sanity.
-Even though theoretically I could do better, I think lack of sleep from the last night affected me too much.
