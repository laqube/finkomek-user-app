-I believe this repo must be called finkomek-web-app <br>
-why?<br>
-Well because there are user and expert applications, two in one. Expert routes are available through /expert-login route.<br>
-Ok then, when the expert app will be ready?
-I don't know, hopefully till the end of this week

-I feel defeated today. Did not write a line of code. I'm doing my best to keep my sanity.
-Even though theoretically I could do better, I think lack of sleep from the last night affected me too much.

-The predefence is tomorrow, gotta work extra hard for this one, and then it's only the matter of implementing videocalls.
So this is my list of todos for this night:
<ul>
 <li>Complete the course purchase on catalogue page</li>
 <li>Render purchased course list on user page</li>
 <li>Render course by content</li>
 <li>Add dynamic routing or think of how to show course content otherwise</li>
 <li>Work on Expert's page</li>
 <li>Work on expert's modal or expert's catalogue page(if catalogue, use dynamic routing)</li>
 <li>Work on Chat layout</li>
</ul>

-So the predefence was yesterday, it went horrific for me. We got the pass to the final defence.
However we got told to fully redesign the customer flow, rework UX/UI, and we still got chat feature to implement.
I got lucky my friend is helping me out with UX/UI, because noone from the core team knows how to design.
After diploma I will onboard on Figma course, UX/UI course and learn design to avoid feeling useless in future.

-Finally finished with all the paperwork, now full focus is on frontend developement once again. 
I hate paperwork, but it suck that I'm the best at it in my team. There are changes we must make to the presentation couple of days before final diploma defence. Just for the context, We've got a bit over a week until the final defence. So yes, I wish myself luck. Deja vu!
